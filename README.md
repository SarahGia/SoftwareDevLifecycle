# SoftwareDevLifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I interpret user needs by communicating directly with users to understand their goals and challenges. Creating user stories helps break down these needs into manageable tasks, making sure that the development aligns with what the users actually want.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach development by focusing on iterative progress, incorporating feedback, and staying flexible. I hope to continue using Agile processes like Sprint Planning and Daily Scrums to keep projects on track and easier to adapt for needed changes. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member means actively communicating, collaborating, and supporting the team’s goals. It’s about being reliable and adaptable, contributing to a positive and productive work environment where goals are aligned.
